# Visualization facilitates uncertainty evaluation of multiple-point geostatistical stochastic simulation
This method primarily utilizes the bubble tree diagram as an interactive framework, capable of supporting both individual realizations and collections composed of multiple realizations, while also providing uncertainty visualization for the entire high-dimensional dataset. To address the parameter adjustment challenge in simulating algorithms for the complete high-dimensional dataset, we propose a parallel coordinates-scatter matrix diagram approach. Furthermore, for analyzing the uncertainty of set members, we employ various visual analysis and evaluation techniques such as Etype diagrams, Bar3d diagrams, MDS diagrams, among others. When examining the uncertainty of a single implementation, we integrate quantitative indicators for uncertainty evaluation, enabling a visual analysis of its uncertainty.
**the video mainly describes the five aspects of the framework:**
> ### 1.load dataset
> ### 2.adjust weight
> ### 3.uncertainty analysis of menmbers in ensemble dataset
> ### 4.uncertainty visualization of realization
> ### 5.uncertainty visualzation of ensemble dataset
